Contact: mjsanimes@gmail.com

1. Overview
Cap Un-cap is a Google Docs add-on that allows users to change the capitalization of selected text (for example, convert uppercase text to lowercase or vice versa). This add-on operates entirely within the user’s Google Docs environment using Google Apps Script.

2. Information We Collect
The add-on does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal or document data outside of the user’s Google account. All processing happens locally in your Google Docs document through Google’s own services.

3. How Information Is Used
The only operation performed by Cap Un-cap is transforming the selected text within the open Google Doc. No data is sent to external servers, databases, or analytics platforms.

4. Data Sharing
We do not share any information with third parties. Google may have access to certain metadata as governed by the Google Privacy Policy when you use Google Docs or Workspace.

5. User Control and Access
Because the add-on does not store or transmit data, users retain full control of their documents and any text transformations. You can remove or uninstall the add-on at any time through the Google Workspace Marketplace or the Google Docs Add-ons menu.

6. Security
All operations occur within Google’s secure infrastructure using Apps Script. No external servers, APIs, or external requests are used.

7. Children’s Privacy
Cap Un-cap is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect any information from them.

8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available at the published URL associated with the add-on listing.

Compliance Statement
Cap Un-cap complies with the Google API Services User Data Policy and the Google Workspace Marketplace Developer Agreement. No sensitive or restricted scopes are used, and no user data is transferred outside Google Workspace.
